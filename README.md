## Password Generator Challenge (Module 3)
The purpose of this challenge was to start creating an online portfolio for potential employers to view.

## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/password-generator and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/password-generator.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:BrennanJLM/password-generator.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)
Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-3-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- This website's main purpose is to serve as a password generator for users to use to create a randomized password. The user will:
